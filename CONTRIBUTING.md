## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow standard Go conventions
- Run `make check` before committing
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments for exported types and functions

### Commit Messages

This repository enforces Conventional Commit style commit titles through a `commit-msg` hook.

Install hooks once after cloning:

```bash
make hooks-install
```

Required first-line format:

```text
<type>(<scope>)!: <subject>
<type>: <subject>
```

Allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`

```

Use clear and descriptive messages:

```
