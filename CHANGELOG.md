## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Flutter VM Service fallback for element finding — when the native driver (WDA/UIAutomator2) can't find a Flutter element, automatically discovers the Dart VM Service and searches the semantics/widget trees in parallel. Works on Android and iOS simulators. Non-Flutter apps pay only one log read on first miss, then fully bypassed. Disable with `--no-flutter-fallback`
- Flutter widget tree cross-reference — when semantics tree search fails, falls back to widget tree analysis (hint text, identifiers, suffix icons) and cross-references with semantics nodes for coordinates
- DeviceLab Android driver — WebSocket-based on-device automation with bounds stabilization for animated elements and special character handling. ~2x faster than UIAutomator2
  ```bash
  maestro-runner --driver devicelab --platform android test flow.yaml
  ```
- `setAirplaneMode` and `toggleAirplaneMode` commands for iOS (WDA) — automates the Settings app to toggle airplane mode on real devices. Supports both mapping and scalar syntax
  ```yaml
  # Mapping syntax
  - setAirplaneMode:
      enabled: true

  # Scalar syntax
  - setAirplaneMode: enabled
  - setAirplaneMode: disabled

  # Toggle (flips current state)
  - toggleAirplaneMode
  ```
- `maxTypingFrequency` support for WDA (iOS) — configurable typing speed via `--typing-frequency` flag. Default: 30 keys/sec (WDA default is 60). Useful for React Native apps where the JS bridge can't keep up at full speed
  ```bash
  maestro-runner --typing-frequency 15 test flow.yaml
  ```
  ```yaml
  # Or set per-flow in YAML config section:
  appId: com.example.app
  typingFrequency: 20
  ---
  - inputText: "hello world"
  ```
- `maxScrolls` and `timeout` fields wired up in `scrollUntilVisible` for all 4 drivers — previously parsed but ignored, now each driver uses dual-condition loop (max scrolls AND timeout)
  ```yaml
  - scrollUntilVisible:
      element:
        text: "Sign Out"
      direction: "down"
      maxScrolls: 5
      timeout: 10000
  ```
- On-failure WebView detection with CDP-aware error enrichment — background CDP socket monitor with push event architecture
- Regex pattern support for ID selectors across all drivers — use regex patterns like wildcards, alternation, and character classes in `id` selectors
  ```yaml
  # Wildcard
  - tapOn:
      id: "username-.*"

  # Alternation
  - assertVisible:
      id: "(username|email)-input"

  # Suffix anchor
  - tapOn:
      id: "login.*-button$"
  ```
- `repeat` with `while` condition now loops correctly instead of executing only once. Supports configurable timeout for the condition check
  ```yaml
  - repeat:
      while:
        visible: "Delete"
        timeout: 2000    # ms to wait before declaring element gone
      commands:
        - tapOn: "Delete"
  ```
- Cloud Providers section in README with TestingBot setup guide

### Fixed
- `runFlow: when` conditions with variable expressions (e.g., `${output.element.id}`) were never expanded, causing conditions to always evaluate as false and silently skip conditional blocks
- iOS real device: `acceptAlertButtonSelector` matched "Don't Allow" instead of "Allow" — `CONTAINS[c] 'Allow'` matched both buttons, causing WDA to reject permission dialogs. Changed to `BEGINSWITH[c] 'Allow'` with `OK` fallback for older iOS versions
- `AllocatePort` was ignoring existing port allocations and `assertCondition` had duplicate `timeout` yaml tag
- `repeat` with `while` condition executed only once instead of looping
- `repeat-while` condition check timeout reduced from 17s to 7s default
- Implicit wait warning resolved by using Appium settings endpoint
- `assertVisible` optional timeout and optimized tap element finding
- WDA `launchApp` optimized: parallel permissions and removed sleeps
- Element finding consolidated: single query with prefetched element name, merged WDA session settings into single HTTP call

## [1.0.7] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- Appium driver: `newSession` option for `launchApp` — creates a fresh Appium session, useful when `clearState` fails on real iOS devices (`mobile: clearApp` unsupported). On iOS real devices with `newSession: true`, `clearState` is skipped since a fresh session already provides clean state ([#14](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/14))
  ```yaml
  - launchApp:
      appId: com.example.app
      newSession: true
  ```
- Bundled UIAutomator2 server upgraded from v9.9.0 to v9.11.1 with new LaunchApp endpoint (`getLaunchIntentForPackage` + `startActivity`)
- Android: classify error types in report (`element_not_found`, `timeout`, `assertion`, `keyboard_covering`, etc.) for better debugging
- Android: detect keyboard covering elements after `inputText`/`inputRandom` — when the soft keyboard covers a target element, taps land on the keyboard instead of the element. Now detects this with a clear error message suggesting `- hideKeyboard`
- Auto-create iOS simulators when not enough shutdown simulators exist for `--parallel` — created simulators are automatically deleted on shutdown
- Parallel device selection: in-use detection via WDA port check (iOS) and socket check (Android) to skip devices already claimed by another maestro-runner instance

### Fixed
- iOS real device: `clearState` no longer kills WDA connection — replaced `go-ios` (`installationproxy`/`zipconduit` over usbmuxd) with `xcrun devicectl` (over Apple's `remoted` daemon), which doesn't interfere with USB port forwarding
- Android: `scroll` and `scrollUntilVisible` direction was inverted — `scroll down` was scrolling up because `/appium/gestures/scroll` already uses scroll semantics, no inversion needed ([#9](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/9))
- Android: `launchApp` failed with "No apps can perform this action" on certain devices — `resolve-activity` was called without `-a android.intent.action.MAIN -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER` flags. New three-tier launch strategy: (1) UIAutomator2 server `getLaunchIntentForPackage()` on-device, (2) shell fallback with proper flags + `dumpsys` parsing + API-level-aware `am start`, (3) monkey fallback ([#15](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/15))
- Android: server APK install now checks version and handles signing conflicts (uninstall + reinstall when version mismatches)
- `index` selector was ignored in simple (non-relative) selectors — `tapOn: text: X, index: 1` always tapped the first match because native driver APIs return only a single element. Now selectors with a non-zero `index` route through page source parsing, which returns all matches and picks the Nth one
- `-e` env variables were not expanding in flow config `appId` — `appId: ${APP_ID}` with `-e APP_ID=com.myapp` sent the literal `${APP_ID}` to adb. Now expands using `ExpandVariables()` before setting as a variable ([#12](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/12))
- Parallel device selection: devices are now filtered by platform (excludes tvOS/watchOS/xrOS) and in-use devices are skipped ([#11](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/11))
- Android: emulator port allocation skipped ports occupied by running emulators
- CLI: flags must come before flow paths in command examples

## [1.0.6] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed
- iOS WDA: off-screen elements no longer returned by `findElement` — `assertVisible`, `tapOn`, `scrollUntilVisible`, and all element commands now correctly reject elements not visible in the viewport
- iOS WDA: `scrollUntilVisible` no longer skips scrolling when the target element exists in the accessibility tree but is off-screen
- iOS WDA: `scrollUntilVisible` direction matching is now case-insensitive (e.g., `direction: "DOWN"` works)
- iOS WDA: `waitForIdleTimeout` now works on iOS via WDA quiescence
- `when: platform` condition was ignored in `runFlow` blocks ([#8](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner/issues/8))

## [1.0.5] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- `tapOn: point` now supports absolute pixel coordinates (e.g., `point: "286, 819"`) in addition to percentages
- Coordinate validation: negative values, out-of-bounds pixels, and percentage range (0-100%) are all rejected with clear error messages
- Screen size cached at session startup instead of fetching on every tap/swipe/scroll
- `launchApp: environment` for passing environment variables via WDA `launchEnvironment`

### Changed
- Extracted shared helpers (`ParsePointCoords`, `ParsePercentageCoords`, `RandomString`, `SuccessResult`, etc.) from drivers into `pkg/core`
- Removed hardcoded 1080x1920 screen size fallback in UIAutomator2 scroll/swipe

### Fixed
- `launchApp: arguments` silently failed on real iOS devices — early return after session creation, unpopulated env map, activate vs launch, missing variable expansion
- Removed unused AI flags (`--analyze`, `--api-url`, `--api-key`)

### Added
- `keyPress` option for character-by-character text input on Android
- Stale socket cleanup on force-stop (Ctrl+C / kill -9) with PID-based locking

- iOS Appium driver: `tapOn` and `inputText` reliability improvements
- iOS Appium driver: skip `--app-file` and `--team-id` pre-checks (not needed for Appium)

- iOS WDA driver: auto-alert handling on simulators (accept/dismiss permission dialogs)
- `takeScreenshot` command now correctly saves PNG files
- GitHub star link in HTML report
- All `errcheck` violations fixed with proper error logging
