"""Tests for waitForAnimationToEnd on Android.

The test launches Android Settings, navigates into a sub-screen (which
produces a visible transition animation) and then calls waitForAnimationToEnd
to confirm the screen has settled.

Prerequisites:
  1. Android emulator running  (``adb devices`` shows a device)
  2. maestro-runner binary built and on PATH (or conftest will auto-start)
  3. Python deps installed:  pip install requests pytest

Run:
  pytest tests/test_wait_for_animation_to_end.py -v
